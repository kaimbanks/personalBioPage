		<h2> Interests </h2>
		<p> Though I've always considered computer science to be the most important aspect of my everyday life, I have a number of interests/hobbies outside of coding. A few examples, and relevant images: </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Photography (specifically astrophotography)</li> <br>
			<img src = "http://www.landscapeastrophotography.com/wp-content/uploads/galleries/post-5/full/28589.jpg" id = "starPhoto"> <br>
			<li> Longboarding (5 minute class commutes are awesome!)</li> <br>

	<div id = "favorites">
		<h2> Favorite Things </h2>
		<p> I'll take a page from The Sound of Music and list a few of my favorite things. </p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/"> Firefly TV Show </a> </li>
			<p> This show isn't for people who won't appreciate some "old-fashioned" special effects, but as far as plot goes, there's a great reason it's rated a 9.1/10 on IMDB. Must-watch show. </p>
