<div id = "favorites">
	<h2> Favorite Things </h2>
	<p> I'll take a page from The Sound of Music and list a few of my favorite things. </p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/"> Firefly TV Show </a> </li>
		<p> This show isn't for people who won't appreciate some "old-fashioned" special effects, but as far as plot goes, there's a great reason it's rated a 9.1/10 on IMDB. Must-watch show. </p>

		<li><a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/"> Fight Club Movie</a> </li>
		<p> I'm not really sure I need to write a description about Fight Club. If you haven't heard of it, you're not really living your life to the fullest. Handily earns a place on my list of favorite things. </p>

		<li><a href = "http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review"> Far Cry 4 Video Game</a> </li>
		<p> I've been playing video games since I was a little kid (in moderation, of course). I've played pretty much every major title ever released on the Xbox and PlayStation, but after all these years, Far Cry 4 stands at the top of the list as the best game I've ever played. If you play games, or are even remotely interested in open-world shooters, go get FC4 now!  </p>

		<li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ItHLz5WEA"> "Faded" by Alan Walker Song </a> </li>
		<p> Music has always been a huge part of my life. I've played the trumpet for over a decade, and love listening to all kinds of music (from classical to EDM to rap). However, my all-time favorite song is an EDM hit by Alan Walker. It's more complicated than your average EDM song, which is why I love it so much. Give it a listen! </p>


	</ul>
</div>

<div id = "skills">
	<h2> Skills/Talents </h2>

	<ul>

		<li> I'll probably beat you at ping-pong </li>

	</ul>

<div id = "summary">
	<h2> Summary </h2>

	<p> This page isn't intended to be a resume. Instead, it's supposed to provide a brief glimpse into who I am both as a person and as a prospective employee. Feel free to reach out to me if you're potentially interested in taking me on as an intern for the summer of 2016! </p>
